## Including BibTex references

There are many ways to manage BibTex references. In [ReadCube Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/), you just right-click to select `Copy...>BibTex entry` and paste it into your BibTex file (I also have a script that formats your entire Papers library for BibTex with meaningful labels).

You can render citations in different ways to accommodate their sentence. Skov et al. reported strong selection on the human X chromosome [-@Skov2023]. Lineages in small populations have shorter coalescence times [see @NielsenSlatkin2016, chap. 1]. The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced [@Prufer2012]. The X chromosome is subject to recurrent sweeps [@Nam2015; @Dutheil2015]. Following @Munch2014, we blah blah...

## Illustrations

You can see an elephant in @fig-elephant.

Elephants are big (@fig-bigelephant):

There are two elephants in @fig-twoelephants. The elephants in @fig-surus and @fig-hanno look similar.

## Plot included from notebook

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#fig-danish-interaction echo=false >}}

(Or bigger)

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#fig-danish-interaction echo=false column=page >}}


## Text included from notebook

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#doc-sampling echo=false >}}

## Table included from notebook

These were selected to represent as many nationalities as possible (@tbl-subjects). 

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#tbl-subjects echo=false >}}

(you can also make the table wider)

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#tbl-subjects echo=false column=page>}}


## Math

This is calculated as $\pi_k = \prod_{i=1}^K x_i$. You can crossref formulas (@eq-definition).

$$
\lambda = \sum_{k=1}^N \pi_k
$$ {#eq-definition}

## Code

Executed but hide code and any output:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

x = 5
```


Show and execute Python code:

```{python}

x = 5
```

Values can be embedded in the text, too. The value of `x` is `{python} x`.

Shown, not executed, Python code:

```python
y = 4
```

Shown, not executed, R code:

```r
z <- 7
```

## Bold and italics

**This is bold**, __so is this__. *This is italics*, _so is this_. __*This is both*__, **_so is this_**.
